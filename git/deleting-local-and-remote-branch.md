# Deleting local and remote branch
---
When deleting local and remote branches there are two scenarios to be considered. First scenario is when the target branch is up to date with main branch:
<pre>
                             main
                               |
commit 1 <--- commit 2 <--- commit 3
                               |
                             test
</pre>
```
git switch main
git branch -d test
git push origin --delete test
```
After deletion the commit history will look like:
<pre>
                             main  
                               |  
commit 1 <--- commit 2 <--- commit 3
</pre>
Second scenario is when the target branch is not up to date with the main branch (with unmerged changed):
<pre>
               main  
                 |  
commit 1 <--- commit 2 <--- commit 3  
                               |  
                             test  
</pre>
To delete the `test` branch: 
```
git switch main
git branch -D test
# delete remote branch
git push origin --delete test
```  
After deletion the commit history will look like:
<pre>
               main  
                 |  
commit 1 <--- commit 2 <--- commit 3  
</pre>
The commit 3 is still in the repo. If we don't have the hash of commit 3 it will be permanently lost because git commit only has reference to its parents but not children. From the commit that main points to, you can only move backward, so thereâ€™s no way for you to reach the commits formerly pointed to by test.

To recover the commit 3:
```
git checkout <hash of commit 3>
git branch <branch name>
```
or if the hash of commit 3 is not remembered:
```
git reflog #get the hash of commit 3
git checkout <hash of commit 3>
git branch <branch name>
```
